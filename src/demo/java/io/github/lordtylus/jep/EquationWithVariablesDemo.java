/**
 * This demo shows how to work with variables in the default configuration.
 * Variables are passed using brackets such as [x] and can take any value.
 * <p>
 * The current value of x is stored in the SimpleStorage implementation and
 * passed into the evaluate method.
 * <p>
 * The equation only needs to be parsed once, and can be used as many times as needed.
 * The default implementations of this framework are stateless and thread safe.
 * <p>
 * However, if the content of the storage changes during evaluation the result will
 * be undefined, and can be potentially wrong.
