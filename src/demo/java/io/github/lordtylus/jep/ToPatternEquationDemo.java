/**
 * This demo provides an example of how a parsed equation can be converted back into
 * a parsable string. This is useful if you want to store the equation in a database
 * for later use, or just generate some debug output.
 * <p>
 * When returning equations back to the string of your choice, you do have to provide a locale for the number format.
 * Supported when parsing are decimal points as period and as comma which should cover most languages.
 * <p>
 * A string using any other format is not parsable at this point in time, but it's something that can be added in the future.
