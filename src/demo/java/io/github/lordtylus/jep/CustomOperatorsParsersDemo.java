 * This demo shows how one would go about if they wanted to add a new operator.

 * <p>
 * First the operator is defined, then a set with all supported operators is created.
 * We take the standard operators and add this one extra.
 * <p>
 * Then a {@link CustomParserOptions} object is created with all these operators.
