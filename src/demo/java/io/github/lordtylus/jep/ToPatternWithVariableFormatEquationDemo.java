 * This demo is an extension of {@link ToPatternEquationDemo} as instead of just the
 * language, it is possible to also set the format to be used for variables.
 * <p>
 * This is useful as depending on your use case printing the variable names in a different
 * format may be necessary. However, keep in mind that a different symbol may result in an unparsable string.
