/**
 * This demo shows that you can also run calculations on the same equation in parallel
 * However, it is important that each calculation has its own storage, since changing the storages
 * value during evaluation will lead to undesired results.
 * <p>
 * In this instance, since there is only one variable in the equation I just pass the value by
 * treating the Storage as a functional interface.
