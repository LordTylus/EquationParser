/**
 * This class helps the {@link VariableParser} and {@link VariableTokenizer}
 * by defining how variables are marked to match the respective use case.
 * <p>
 * Only single characters are supported. While the {@link VariableParser}
 * could theoretically work with a character sequence, the {@link VariableTokenizer} cannot.
 * <p>
 * Hence only single characters are allowed.
 *
 * @param isEscaped        This method signals both the {@link VariableTokenizer} and the {@link VariableParser} if there are any characters wrapping the variable name or not.
 *                         <p>
 *                         If this variable returns false the results of {@link #openingCharacter} and {@link #closingCharacter} are set to some default and are therefore to be ignored.
 * @param openingCharacter The opening character of a Variable.
 *                         <p>
 *                         The default implementation uses '[' but the implementation can use any other character.
 *                         However, the implementation has to be careful to not use any characters used by different parsers.
 *                         For example using any of the operators would lead to confusion and parsing errors.
 * @param closingCharacter The closing character of a Variable.
 *                         <p>
 *                         The default implementation uses ']' but the implementation can use any other character.
