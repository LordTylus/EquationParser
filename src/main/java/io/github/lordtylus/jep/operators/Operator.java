/**
 * An operator is the equivalent of an operator in mathematics such as the plus sign for addition or the minus sign for subtraction.
 * <p>
 * The operator has a symbol for parsing, an order in a hierarchy, and an evaluation function that will perform the operation using two numbers.
 * What calculation exactly is being performed is dependent on the passed {@link #evalFunction}
 * <p>
 * An operator can only have one char as a symbol such as + or - and during parsing of an {@link Equation Equation} its order is respected.
 * <p>
 * The smaller the order the later the operation is performed. In Mathematics the PEMDAS standard states that operators should be solved in order:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Parentheses -> not an operator, see {@link Parenthesis Parenthesis}</li>
 *     <li>Exponents -> 2</li>
 *     <li>Multiplication/Division -> 1</li>
 *     <li>Addition/Subtraction -> 0</li>
 * </ul>
 * The standard implementations of this framework respect this order.
 * <p>
 * In case custom operators are created alongside the standard ones, it's important to think about how it would fit in the PEMDAS order to not result in unexpected results.
 *
 * @param order        the order of operators. Operators with a lower number will be solved last. Operators with the same number are solved left to right.
 * @param pattern      the symbol of the operator.
 * @param evalFunction the function applying the operation to the two given numbers.
